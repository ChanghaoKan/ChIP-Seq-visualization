Chip-seq analysis protocol
HepG2 E2F1 Chip-seq as an example
#### create conda environment for Chip-seq
#conda create Chip_test environment
conda create -n Chip_test -y
#conda activate Chip_test environment (if activation is successful, you can see the environment changed from base to Chip_test)
conda activate Chip_test
#Check the packages in the current conda environment (if there are no sra-tools to download)
conda list
#Install the download software (for downloading sra data)
conda install -c biobuilds sra-tools -y

#### download data
#Create a new folder for storing the raw data
mkdir Chip_ENCSR717ZZW
#Go to the Chip_ENCSR717ZZW1 file
cd Chip_ENCSR717ZZW
#Check the address
pwd

#### analyze the data
1. ENCFF049BWK.bed.gz
File format: BED (Browser Extensible Data)
Content: Contains information on the location of ChIP-seq peaks, usually E2F1-bound regions on the genome.
Uses.
Identifies E2F1 binding sites.
Intersection analysis with other BED files (e.g. other transcription factors or histone modifications) to study co-localization phenomena.
Annotate genes near the peaks and hypothesize target genes of E2F1.
Tools.
Use bedtools for BED file manipulation (e.g., intersection, merging, annotation, etc.).
Use tools such as GREAT or ChIPseeker for functional annotation.
2. ENCFF354YZN.bigWig
File format: bigWig
Content: Contains genome-wide ChIP-seq signal intensities, typically used for visualization.
Uses.
Visualize E2F1 binding signals in genome browsers (e.g. UCSC Genome Browser, IGV).
Compare signal intensities across samples or conditions.
Extract signal values for specific regions (e.g. promoters, enhancers, etc.).
Tools.
Convert bigWig to other formats using bamCoverage or bigWigToBedGraph in deepTools.
Use pyBigWig or rtracklayer (R package) to programmatically extract signal values.
3. ENCFF919WXY.bigBed
File format: bigBed
Content: Similar to a BED file, but more suitable for storing large-scale datasets and usually contains annotation information.
Uses.
Visualize annotation information in the genome browser.
Extract annotation information for specific regions (e.g. genes, exons, etc.).
Tools.
Convert bigBed to BED format using bigBedToBed.
Use UCSC Genome Browser to view directly.
#Unzip
gunzip ENCFF049BWK.bed.gz
# Check the contents of the file
head ENCFF049BWK.bed
# Count the number of peaks
wc -l ENCFF049BWK.bed
