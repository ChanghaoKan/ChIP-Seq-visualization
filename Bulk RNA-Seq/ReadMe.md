This bash script automates the initial steps of a bulk RNA-seq analysis pipeline, covering environment setup, data download, quality control, read trimming, alignment, and gene count generation. It is designed to be run on a Linux system with Conda installed and prepares the data for downstream differential expression analysis.
Purpose of the Script
The script performs the following key tasks:
Environment Setup: Creates and configures a Conda environment with necessary tools for RNA-seq analysis.

Data Download: Downloads sequencing data from URLs provided in a urls.txt file.

File Organization: Organizes the downloaded files into directories based on experimental conditions and batches.

Quality Control: Runs FastQC on raw and trimmed reads and generates MultiQC reports to assess data quality.

Read Trimming: Uses Trim Galore to remove low-quality bases and adapters from the reads.

Alignment: Aligns the trimmed reads to a reference genome using STAR and generates sorted BAM files and gene counts.

Expression Quantification: Merges gene counts from all samples into a single file for downstream analysis.

Note: This script handles the preprocessing and alignment steps but does not include downstream differential expression analysis (e.g., using DESeq2), which should be performed separately.
Tools and Packages Used
The script installs and utilizes the following tools within a Conda environment:
FastQC: For quality control of raw and trimmed sequencing reads.

MultiQC: For aggregating and summarizing FastQC reports into a single overview.

Trim Galore: For trimming low-quality bases and adapters from reads.

STAR: For aligning reads to the reference genome and generating gene counts.

Additionally, the environment includes the following tools, which are not directly used in this script but may be required for further analysis:
Samtools: For manipulating and analyzing BAM files.

Subread: For read counting and other utilities (e.g., featureCounts).

R-base (version 4.3.1): For statistical computing and downstream analysis.

Bioconductor-DESeq2: For differential gene expression analysis.

Script Sections
The script is divided into seven main sections, each handling a specific part of the pipeline:
1. Environment Setup
Creates a new Conda environment and installs the necessary tools and libraries.

Saves the environment configuration to a YAML file (environment.yml) for reproducibility.

2. Data Download
Downloads sequencing data from URLs listed in a urls.txt file.

Handles URLs with parameters and special characters to ensure correct file naming and download.

3. File Organization
Organizes the downloaded fastq files into directories based on experimental conditions and batches (e.g., condition1/batch1, condition2/batch1, etc.).

4. Quality Control (Raw Data)
Runs FastQC on the raw paired-end fastq files to assess data quality.

Generates a MultiQC report to summarize the quality control results for all samples.

5. Read Trimming
Uses Trim Galore to trim low-quality bases and adapters from the reads.

Runs FastQC on the trimmed reads and generates another MultiQC report to verify the trimming quality.

6. Alignment with STAR
Builds a STAR index using the provided reference genome and annotation files.

Aligns the trimmed reads to the reference genome, producing sorted BAM files and gene count files for each sample.

7. Expression Quantification
Merges the gene counts from all samples into a single tab-delimited file (gene_counts.txt) for downstream differential expression analysis.

Usage and Customization
To use this script effectively, users should be aware of the following:
Input Requirements:
A urls.txt file containing the download URLs for the sequencing data (one URL per line).

Reference genome and annotation files (e.g., FASTA and GTF files) must be downloaded separately and their paths specified in the script.

Customization:
Replace placeholders such as <env_name>, <genome_file>, and <annotation_file> with actual values specific to your analysis.

Adjust file naming patterns in sed commands if your fastq files have different suffixes (e.g., _R1.fastq.gz instead of _1.fq.gz).

Modify the directory structure to match your experimental design (e.g., different condition or batch names).

Output:
Quality control reports are saved in qc_reports/.

Trimmed reads are stored in trimmed_data/.

Aligned BAM files are saved in aligned_data/.

The merged gene count matrix is saved as counts/gene_counts.txt.

Conclusion
This script provides a robust and reproducible framework for the early stages of RNA-seq analysis, from data retrieval to gene count generation. By following the steps outlined in this documentation, users can adapt the script to their specific datasets and experimental designs, ensuring a smooth transition to downstream analyses such as differential expression testing.
